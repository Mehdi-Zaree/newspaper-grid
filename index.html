            <div>Tupac Shakur, a rapper and actor who built a career on controversy, died of wounds yesterday from a drive-by shooting last Saturday. He was 25 years old.</div>
            <div>Mr. Shakur was a complex and sometimes contradictory figure, with a career featuring million-selling albums, gunshot wounds and run-ins with the police. He was an intelligent, vivid writer who had studied acting at the High School of Performing Arts in Baltimore; he was an accomplished rapper with a husky baritone and crisp enunciation. He was also a convicted sex offender, and the words ''Thug Life'' and ''Outlaw'' were tattooed on his body.</div>
            <div>In some raps, Mr. Shakur glamorized the life of the ''player,'' a high-living, macho gangster flaunting ill-gotten gains. But in many others, sometimes on the same albums, he portrayed the gangster life as a desperate, self-destructive existence of fear and sudden death. He described gangsterism as a vicious cycle, a grimly inevitable response to racism, ghetto poverty and police brutality.</div>
